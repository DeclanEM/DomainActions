        <h3>DomainActions is designed to make it really easy to manage lots of tabs from various websites all with a few simple options.<br />Everything the extension does will be applied to ALL the tabs you have open on a certain website, not just the one you click on.</h3>
        <hr />
        <h4>DomainActions is always one click away, just right click on any tab and find the DomainActions menu at the bottom of the list. From the menu you'll have several actions to choose from:</h4>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li>New Window</li>
            <p>Move all the tabs in your selected domain to a new window, leaving the others where they are.</p>
            <li>Refresh</li>
            <p>Refresh all the tabs in your selected domain.</p>
            <li>Close</li>
            <p>Close all the tabs in your selected domain.</p>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <h4>In addition DomainActions has several options you can configure to suit your needs:</h4>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li>Current Window (Enabled by default)</li>
            <p>Disabling this option allows DomainActions to act on tabs in every open window, not just the ones in your current window.</p>
            <li>Except Active (Disabled by default)</li>
            <p>Enabling this option makes DomainActions ignore the currently active tab if it's part of the selected domain.</p>
            <li>Bypass Cache (Disabled by default)</li>
            <p>Enabling this option forces every reloaded tab to bypass the browser cache.</p>
        </ul>
